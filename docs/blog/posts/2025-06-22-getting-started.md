# Getting Started with Material for MkDocs

Welcome to my first blog post! Today I want to share how I set up this beautiful blog using Material for MkDocs.

<!-- more -->

## Why Material for MkDocs?

Material for MkDocs is an amazing static site generator that combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of modern web technologies. Here's why I chose it:

!!! tip "Key Benefits"
    - 🎨 **Beautiful Design**: Built with Google's Material Design
    - 📱 **Responsive**: Works perfectly on all devices
    - 🚀 **Fast**: Static sites load incredibly quickly
    - 🔍 **Search**: Built-in search functionality
    - 📝 **Markdown**: Write in simple, readable Markdown

## Features I Love

### Code Highlighting

```python title="hello.py"
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """A simple greeting function."""
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my blog!"

# Usage
message = greet("World")
print(message)
```

### Admonitions

!!! example "This is an example"
    You can create beautiful callout boxes like this one!

!!! warning "Be Careful"
    Make sure to customize the configuration according to your needs.

### Math Support

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$
